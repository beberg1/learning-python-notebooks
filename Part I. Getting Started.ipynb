    "The Interpreter's View: More is going on \"under the hood\", internal processes that is almost completely hidden from the programmer. Python internally compiles the source-code to lower-level byte code at runtime, and saves them for later use (*.pyc*-files). These files are saved in a subdirectory called __pycache__. The reason behind the compilation is speed optimalization. Bytecode files are only saved for imported Python-files. \n",
